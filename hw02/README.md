### Reporting the process
* I am finding it relatively easy to keep my repo organized as we begin to add more work.  I found a nifty trick of being able to alter the folder structure either through my 'finder' on my mac or through github by creating new files within files which automatically creates a folder. After doing this I am sure to make sure I commit any changes on documents I am working on in Rstudio, pull from the repo and then push so there are no merge conflicts
* Having so many functions to query data is very useful, but it can be hard to remember which is the best to use in each case.  I am enjoying being able to distill information using the dply piping with filter() and select() 
* To save myself the hassle of retyping I am trying to assign variables to complicated functions when I can so it is simpler to use strings of code in ggplot for example, when using geom_point () and using several functions to get colours, lines of best fit etc. 
* I found it easy to find lots of plotting functions in ggplot even though we haven't used many of them in class.  I found Jenny's ggplot tutorials very helpful and also used the ? help function in RStudio and found many helpful examples there
* To challenge myself I asked a question of the dataset and worked backwards learning new functions to try and solve it.  I found it to be a very helpful way to learn new things!
