### About Me 
I am a first year PhD student at the Institute of Resources, Environment and Sustainability.  I've spent the last four years living and working in Edmonton, Alberta. I am originally from Calgary.  I enjoy travelling, outdoor activities, gardening and reading. I have recently taken up powerlifting.

### Research Interests
My primary research interests are in the areas of agriculture and food security, especially how production challenges will mount in the face of a changing climate. I am interested in how these changes have and will in the future affect production systems in northern countries including Canada.

>“The quest for food security can be the common thread that links the different challenges we face and helps build a sustainable future.”
