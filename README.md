### About Me 
I am a first year PhD student at the Institute of Resources, Environment and Sustainability.  I've spent the last four years living and working in Edmonton, Alberta. I am originally from Calgary.  I enjoy travelling, outdoor activities, gardening and reading. I have recently taken up powerlifting.

### Research Interests
My primary research interests are in the areas of agriculture and food security, especially how production challenges will mount in the face of a changing climate. I am interested in how these changes have and will in the future affect production systems in northern countries including Canada.

I used to work for a government agency, focused on providing [funding for agriculture and food issues](http://albertainnovates.ca/ "Alberta Innovates").  My time working for this organization gave me an interesting perpective on how climate change adaptation is already on-going from a plant breeding and agronomy perspective as well as in biological greenhouse gas management of livestock.
