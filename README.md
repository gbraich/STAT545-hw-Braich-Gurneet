### About Me 
I am a first year PhD student at the Institute of Resources, Environment and Sustainability.  I've spent the last four years living and working in Edmonton, Alberta. I am originally from Calgary.  I enjoy travelling, outdoor activities, gardening and reading. I have recently taken up powerlifting.

### Research Interests
My primary research interests are in the areas of agriculture and food security, especially how production challenges will mount in the face of a changing climate. I am interested in how these changes have and will in the future affect production systems in northern countries including Canada.

>“The quest for food security can be the common thread that links the different challenges we face and helps build a sustainable future.”

### The Process

* Edits were made by using version control to clone an existing Git repository that was created for this homework assignment
* Edits were made locally using R-Studio
* All edits were saved, committed using the Git tab, a git pull was performed to make sure everything was up-to-date and then pushed to github.com
* Writing the text was easy in R-Studio but getting familar with the syntax took a while
* I found it helpful to use [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p) which was listed on the Stat545 page 
* I found some disprepancies between what the html looked like in preview vs. on Github in an md file
* I found R Markdown fun to work with after getting used to the keyboard shortcuts to bring up the '''r{} function
* I really enjoyed working the Gapminder dataset, especially changing x and y axis variables to see how correlated different socio-economic indicators are, as well as looking at the data by grouping by continent
* Gapminder for hw01 [md file](https://github.com/gbraich/STAT545-hw-Braich-Gurneet/blob/master/hw01/hw01_gapminder.md)
* Hw02 [README](https://github.com/gbraich/STAT545-hw-Braich-Gurneet/blob/master/hw02/README.md)
