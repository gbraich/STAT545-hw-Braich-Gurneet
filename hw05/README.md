### Reporting the process
* Working with factors and levels was more difficult than I thought!  I was starting to confuse myself after a while!
* I really enjoy ggplot2 so it was lots of fun to use the new visualization designs we learned in class
* It was good to clean up the repo and rerender everything
* Saving to file was a bit tricky but I managed to embed my image in the end which was good!
