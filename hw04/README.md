### Reporting the process
* I am finding it easier to remember all the join functions after this assignment
* This assignment was good pratice to also try the gather and spread functions
* I tried to use the match function on gapminder data as well as on the tibble I created, but it wasn't working as both tables have lengths that exceed the maximum
