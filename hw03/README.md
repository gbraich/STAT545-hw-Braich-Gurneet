### Reporting the process
* I am finding it relatively easy now to use ggplot2, piping and dplyr functions
* What is still difficult at times is picking the right dplyr functions depending on what I am trying to query from the data
* I've been using different resources online to find new functions that have been helpful, for example top_n and aggregate
* I also tried to use knitr::kable whenever I could to make my tables look nicer in html
* I would the last task (getting the figure and table side by side) tricky to do because I have very little experience with style elements
* Again it was helpful to use css resources online to find out how I should designate my figure and table, and use style elements to have them float left or right and take up 50% of the width
* I hope to use these elements more in the future
